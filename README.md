# IoT-Based Pulse Oximeter System

This project is a conceptual design of an IoT-based pulse oximeter that monitors a patientâ€™s oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate in real time and transmits the data wirelessly to a cloud platform or healthcare provider.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

In critical care and pandemic situations, real-time tracking of oxygen saturation and pulse rate becomes essential. Manual monitoring is inefficient and cannot scale across multiple patients.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To create a system that uses a pulse oximeter sensor with IoT capability to:
- Monitor SpO2 and pulse rate continuously
- Send data to the cloud for storage or remote access
- Alert healthcare providers in case of abnormalities
- 
## ðŸ”§ Components Used

- **MAX30100 / MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter Sensor**
- **Arduino UNO or NodeMCU**
- **ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module**
- **OLED or LCD Display (optional)**
- **Thingspeak or Blynk Cloud Platform**
- **Buzzer (for threshold alerts)**
